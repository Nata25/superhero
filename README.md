# Being a Super Hero

Trainee project for the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design) online course by _University of London, Goldsmiths, University of London_ on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

[Certificate earned](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/Y9Y64XDBS5MU) in August 2016.

## Overview

ASSIGNMENT: Make a __task list__, i.e. a sample web site for collecting and navigating through tasks (front-end part only). 
- Should contain the following pages: "Home", "About", "All tasks", and one task description. 
- Use some Bootstrap custom theme. 
- Follow the principles of user-friendly navigation: at any time user should be able to answer the questions: *Where I am?, Where can I go?*

MY IMPLEMENTATION: Amusing web diary of imaginary _Super Hero_ with tasks like "Save the world" or "Solve one of a Hilbert math problems". The page meets all technical requirements stated in the assignment and provides some additional features.

## Tech details:

`Bootstrap` use:
- site is fully responsive
- [Super Hero](https://bootswatch.com/superhero/) Bootstrap theme was used (it's just a coincidence!)
- collapsable mobile nav with `jQuery`
- active class on current nav tab and breadcrumbs to improve navigating.

Buttons are clickable but do not fire any functionality like login or adding a task to a list (needs back-end part to be implemented).
